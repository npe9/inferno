# Introduction #

One of my main goals for this distribution is to have an inferno tree that will just install with a minimum of fuss for the user. To do this I'm working on a set of shell scripts that allow you to deploy a cpu, auth or fs servers on a unix machine automatically.

One of the main problems I run into when I'm deploying inferno is having a common set of keys. Depending on where I am I'm behind a bunch of firewalls which makes it difficult to figure out where and when I should be authenticating.
