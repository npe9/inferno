| mksdir | makes a new synthetic directory |
|:-------|:--------------------------------|
| stouch | creates a new synthetic? |
| sdup | duplicates a new hierarchy and gives it new fids? |
| schmod | changes the permissions for a file |

The main issue here is going to be figuring out the logic of what individual files do when they're read, written and stated.

need to be able to create new trees as well(i.e. when you create a new tcp connection). a read/write module interface might be interesting. then you could feed it dis files(what about commands?). How will this differ from/be better than file2chan?
