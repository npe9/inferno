.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Export
calls
.B Sys->export
(see
.IR sys-dial (2))
to serve a name space rooted at
.I dir
over a connection to a Styx client.
.I Export
opens the connection on the given
.IR file ,
or uses the standard input by default.
It returns when the client closes the connection.
If the
.B \-a
option is given, however,
.I export
starts an Inferno kernel process
to serve the name space and returns immediately.
.I Export
serves the current name space without forking it; changes made to it
will be visible to clients.
.PP
.I Export
starts serving Styx immediately; it assumes that the connection
has been authenticated if required.
<<<<<<< HEAD:man/4/export
=======
.I Export
is typically called via
.IR listen (1),
which can authenticate the connection.
.SH EXAMPLE
Start a background process to serve the name space on the serial port.
.IP
.B "export / /dev/eia0 &"
.PP
Although useful when bootstrapping a system, this is unsafe
unless a transport protocol is run on the connection.
