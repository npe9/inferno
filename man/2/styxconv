.TH STYXCONV 2
.SH NAME
styxconv \- convert between old and new Styx
.SH SYNOPSIS
.EX
include "styxconv.m";
styxconv := load Styxconv Styxconv->PATH;

init:     fn();
styxconv: fn(to: ref Sys->FD, from: ref Sys->FD, pid: chan of int);
.EE
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Styxconv
converts between the previous version of the Styx protocol,
as used for instance in Inferno's Third Edition and earlier,
and the current version of the protocol,
based on 9P2000 and defined by
.IR intro (5).
.PP
.B Init
must be called before any other function in the module.
.PP
The function
.B styxconv
takes two file descriptors.
.I From
must be a connection to a file server that serves the original, older
version of Styx.
.I To
is a connection, perhaps a pipe, to something that requires the current protocol;
.B Sys->mount
for instance
(see
.IR sys-bind (2)).
.B Styxconv
is spawned by the caller, to create a process that copies messages between
.I from
and
.IR to ,
converting as required as it goes.
Its process ID is the only message sent on
channel
.IR pidc ;
it must be received by
.BR styxconv 's
caller.
See the example below.
.SH EXAMPLE
Apply
.B styxconv
to file descriptor
.I fd
connected to an old Styx server:
.IP
.EX
cvstyx(fd: ref Sys->FD): ref Sys->FD
{
	styxconv := load Styxconv Styxconv->PATH;
	if(styxconv == nil)
		return nil;
	p := array[2] of ref Sys->FD;
	if(sys->pipe(p) < 0)
		return nil;
	styxconv->init();
	pidc := chan of int;
	spawn styxconv->styxconv(p[1], fd, pidc);
	<-pidc;
	return p[0];
}
